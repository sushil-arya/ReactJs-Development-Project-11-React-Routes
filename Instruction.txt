How we can dynamically load component with URL patterns?

URL = Uniform Resource Locator

The default URL of ReactJs Application is 

this is a URL of React Application
Base Address
http://localhost:3000

if we put '/' after base address then it is called Home Route
Base Address/  -> /Home Route


Base Address /someRoute

Suppose I have to create 2 pages
1. Login
     http://localhost:3000/login
2. Register
      http://localhost:3000/register

3. Home
       http://localhost:3000



 To load the Component Dynamically need to install 3rd Party library 'react-router-dom' with the help of npm

react-router-dom 

npm is download utility for nodejs application

npm = node package manager

npm install <somelibrary> -----> https://npmjs.com ---> download

npm install react-router-dom --save

Folder Structure

public/index.html (view file)
src/index.js (login file)
package.json

npm start --> react-script-start --->  src/index.js --->>> WebPack (Bundler) --- Babel Js Compiler --- public/index.html


React Router Dom (Structure of GrandParent > Parent > Child )

BrowserRouter (Grand-Parent)
         Routes (Parent)
             Route (Child)

<div id = "BrowserRouter">
		<div id="Routes">
                       <div id="route"></div>
                </div>
 </div>
